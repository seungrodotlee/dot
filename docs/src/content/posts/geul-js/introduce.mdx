# Implement perfect typing effect in React with Geul.js!

`Geul.js` is a library designed to easily implement
the typing effect of Korean characters,
where characters are decomposed into
initial, medial, and final consonants
as they are typed and then combined.

```ts
const Page = () => {
  const { geul, run, reset } = useGeul("안녕하세요", {
    initial: "",
    speed: 50,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    run();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>{geul}</div>
  );
};
```

# Install Geul.js for React

Install via Package Manager

```sh
npm i @dot/react-geul
```

# Usage

You can use `Geul.js` by import `@dot/react-geul` package and just simply call hooks. `@dot/react-geul` provides three types of hooks.

- `useGeul`
- `useDynamicGeul`
- `useGeulPipe`

# Geul.js for other frameworks (eg. `Vue.js`, `Svelte`)

`Geul.js` have plan to support `Vue.js` and `Svelde`, and other frameworks,
but not in the process of developing it yet.
I will work on it quickly and release it soon.
