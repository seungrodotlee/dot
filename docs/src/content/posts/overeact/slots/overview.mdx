# Slot component with React!

[Slot component](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html) is concept
mainly used in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), allowing component-developers to
place user-delivered elements exactly in the right place.

With `Overeact`, you can use the concept in `React.js` also.

You can implement it by `HOC` or `hooks`, whatever you like.
